# CTF Writeups Repository

A collection of my Capture The Flag (CTF) competition writeups, solutions, and tools.

## Overview

This repository contains detailed writeups and solutions for various CTF challenges I've participated in. Each writeup documents my approach to solving the challenges, including the techniques used, code snippets, and lessons learned.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by CTF events, with each event having its own directory:

```

│   ├── challenge2/
│   └── README.md
├── EventName2_Year/
│   ├── challenge1/
│   └── README.md
└── ...
```

Each event directory contains:
- Individual challenge directories or files
- A README summarizing the event and challenges
- Any scripts or tools developed for the challenges

## Categories

Challenges are typically categorized as:
- Web Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Binary Exploitation
- Reverse Engineering

- Miscellaneous

## Tools

Some writeups include custom tools and scripts developed to solve specific challenges. These are provided for educational purposes and to demonstrate practical approaches to CTF problem-solving.

## Disclaimer

These writeups are shared for educational purposes only. The techniques described should only be used in authorized environments and competitions.
